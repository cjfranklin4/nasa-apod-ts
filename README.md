# NASA APOD Revamp with TypeScript

This is a revamp of my initial [NASA APOD API project](https://github.com/cjfranklin4/nasa-image-of-day-api) created using the [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov) API, TypeScript, React, and Chakra UI.

# Project Goals
The initial goal for this project was to get comfortable with using TypeScript in React, especially when passing props and HTML click and submit events.

The next steps for this project are:
- Have the current NASA APOD Image and description display when the web app is opened
